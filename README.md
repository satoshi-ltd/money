# Môney

Private, local‑first finance ledger for people who want their data to stay on device.

**Why Môney**
- Your data never leaves your phone by default.
- Simple, fast tracking across multiple currencies.
- Backups are portable JSON files you control.

**Core features**
- Multi‑currency accounts and transactions
- Scheduled transactions (weekly/monthly)
- Spending and income analytics
- Local insights (trends, unusual spend alerts, and monthly pace)
- Import from JSON backup
- Export JSON backup + CSV export (Pro)
- Optional weekly backup reminders
- Automatic category suggestions while typing
- Multi‑language UI (EN/ES/PT/FR/DE)

**Platforms**
- iOS and Android only (no web support).
- iOS baseline: 15.1+

**Privacy first**
Môney is designed to run offline and store data locally. Some features use the network (rates sync, purchases, optional onboarding email), and should remain opt‑in and transparent.

**Roadmap**
See `backlog.md`.
